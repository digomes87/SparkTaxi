üìä ANALYSIS OVERVIEW
===================
This document contains the comprehensive results from the NYC Taxi Data Analysis
performed using Apache Spark. The analysis includes temporal patterns, distance-
duration relationships, and statistical insights.

üïê TEMPORAL ANALYSIS RESULTS
============================

Hourly Trip Distribution:
------------------------
Hour | Trip Count
-----|----------
  7  |    1
  8  |    1
  9  |    1
 10  |    1
 12  |    1
 13  |    1
 14  |    1
 15  |    1
 16  |    1
 17  |    2

Key Findings:
- Peak hour identified at 17:00 (5 PM) with 2 trips
- Consistent activity throughout business hours (7 AM - 5 PM)
- Evening rush hour shows increased demand

üìè DISTANCE-DURATION-FARE ANALYSIS
==================================

1. BASIC STATISTICS
------------------
Metric          | Trip Distance | Trip Duration | Fare Amount
----------------|---------------|---------------|-------------
Count           |      10       |      10       |     10
Mean            |     3.19      |    1170.0     |   15.05
Std Deviation   |     0.74      |    221.36     |    2.71
Minimum         |     1.8       |     900       |   11.0
Maximum         |     4.2       |    1500       |   19.5

Key Insights:
- Average trip distance: 3.19 miles
- Average trip duration: 19.5 minutes (1170 seconds)
- Average fare: $15.05
- Trip duration varies significantly (15-25 minutes range)

2. SPEED ANALYSIS
----------------
Metric          | Speed (mph)
----------------|-------------
Count           |     10
Mean            |   10.07
Std Deviation   |    2.42
Minimum         |    4.32
Maximum         |   12.8

Key Insights:
- Average speed: 10.07 mph (typical for NYC traffic)
- Speed variation indicates different traffic conditions
- Minimum speed (4.32 mph) suggests heavy traffic periods
- Maximum speed (12.8 mph) indicates lighter traffic conditions

3. CORRELATION ANALYSIS
======================
Correlation Matrix Results:

                | Trip Distance | Trip Duration | Fare Amount
----------------|---------------|---------------|-------------
Trip Distance   |     1.000     |     0.120     |    0.982
Trip Duration   |     0.120     |     1.000     |    0.225
Fare Amount     |     0.982     |     0.225     |    1.000

Critical Findings:
- STRONG correlation (0.982) between trip distance and fare amount
- WEAK correlation (0.120) between trip distance and duration
- WEAK correlation (0.225) between trip duration and fare amount

üìà BUSINESS INSIGHTS
===================

1. PRICING STRATEGY
------------------
- Distance is the PRIMARY factor in fare calculation (98.2% correlation)
- Time-based pricing has minimal impact on total fare
- Consistent pricing model across different trip lengths

2. OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY
------------------------
- Low distance-duration correlation suggests traffic variability
- Average speed of 10 mph aligns with NYC urban conditions
- Duration prediction requires traffic pattern consideration

3. DEMAND PATTERNS
-----------------
- Evening rush hour (5 PM) shows peak demand
- Consistent demand throughout business hours
- Opportunity for dynamic pricing during peak hours

üéØ KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS
=============================

Service Metrics:
- Average Trip Distance: 3.19 miles
- Average Trip Duration: 19.5 minutes
- Average Speed: 10.07 mph
- Average Fare: $15.05
- Fare per Mile: $4.72

Efficiency Metrics:
- Distance-Fare Correlation: 98.2% (Excellent)
- Speed Consistency: 76% (Good - considering traffic)
- Duration Predictability: Low (due to traffic variability)

üîç RECOMMENDATIONS
==================

1. PRICING OPTIMIZATION
----------------------
- Maintain distance-based pricing model (highly effective)
- Consider traffic-adjusted time surcharges for peak hours
- Implement dynamic pricing during high-demand periods

2. OPERATIONAL IMPROVEMENTS
--------------------------
- Focus on route optimization to improve average speed
- Develop traffic-aware duration prediction models
- Monitor peak hour capacity to meet demand

3. DATA COLLECTION ENHANCEMENT
-----------------------------
- Collect real-time traffic data for better duration prediction
- Track weather conditions impact on trip patterns
- Implement customer satisfaction metrics
