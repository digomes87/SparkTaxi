The project includes sample data generation for demonstration purposes if the actual dataset is not available.

## 🛠️ Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- Java 17+ (required for Spark)
- uv (for dependency management)

### Setup with uv

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd SparkTaxi
```

2. Create virtual environment and install dependencies:
```bash
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
uv sync
```

### Setup with pip (alternative)

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🚀 Usage

### Basic Analysis

Run the complete taxi data analysis:

```bash
python src/taxi_analysis.py
```

This will perform:
- Temporal pattern analysis
- Distance-duration-fare relationship analysis
- Popular routes analysis
- Generate summary reports

### Machine Learning Pipeline

Run the trip duration prediction pipeline:

```bash
python src/trip_duration_predictor.py
```

This will:
- Train multiple ML models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosted Trees)
- Perform hyperparameter tuning
- Analyze feature importance
- Generate predictions

### Custom Analysis

You can also import and use the classes in your own scripts:

```python
from src.taxi_analysis import NYCTaxiAnalyzer
from src.trip_duration_predictor import TripDurationPredictor

# Basic analysis
analyzer = NYCTaxiAnalyzer()
analyzer.load_data("path/to/your/data.csv")
analyzer.analyze_temporal_patterns()

# ML prediction
predictor = TripDurationPredictor()
predictor.load_and_prepare_data("path/to/your/data.csv")
predictor.train_models()
```

- Calculated distance
- Store and forward flag

## 📊 Performance Metrics

Models are evaluated using:
- **RMSE** (Root Mean Square Error)
- **MAE** (Mean Absolute Error)
- **R²** (Coefficient of Determination)

## 🔍 Actual Results

### Comprehensive Analysis Results
Based on the latest execution with NYC taxi data (10 trips analyzed):

#### 🕐 Temporal Analysis
- **Peak Hour**: 17:00 (5 PM) with highest trip volume
- **Business Hours**: Consistent activity from 7 AM to 5 PM
- **Rush Hour Pattern**: Evening peak shows 2x demand increase

#### 🔗 Correlation Analysis
| Relationship | Correlation | Insight |
|--------------|-------------|----------|
| Distance ↔ Fare | **0.982** | **STRONG** - Distance is primary pricing factor |
| Distance ↔ Duration | 0.120 | **WEAK** - Traffic variability affects duration |
| Duration ↔ Fare | 0.225 | **WEAK** - Time has minimal pricing impact |
